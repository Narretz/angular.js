# Contributing & Core Development

For everything related to contributing, we have a document in our Git Repository that covers
everything from submitting issues, setting up and building the code, to writing documentation,
and much more: [Contributing](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
